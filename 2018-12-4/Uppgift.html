<h2>Black Ops 4</h2>
Featuring no traditional campaign mode for the first time in the franchise, Black Ops 4 puts all its attention into three distinct modes:
Multiplayer, Zombies, and the all-new battle royale mode Blackout.
However, the game will include single-player Solo Missions that focus on the lore and stories of the game's multiplayer characters, or "Specialists."
Multiplayer is traditional, yet redefined, featuring gritty, grounded, fluid multiplayer combat.
Zombies contains brand new experiences along with more customization on how the player wishes to play, with the deep gameplay and easter eggs that its fans have come to expect.
Blackout is a brand new addition to the Call of Duty franchise.
It is Treyarch's take on the battle royale genre of games, where the universe of Black Ops comes to life in one massive battle royale experience featuring the largest map in Call of Duty history,
signature Black Ops combat, characters, locations and weapons from the entire Black Ops series.

        <h2>Quick Facts!</h2>
        Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 got off to a pretty great start last weekend.

        The game is getting great reviews (mine won't be out until the game has been in the wild for a couple weeks precisely because of the issues I discuss in this post)
        and it's making Activision great big heaps of money.

        I'm really enjoying both multiplayer and Blackout (the game's new battle royale mode) but not everyone is happy. If you've noticed that Black Ops 4
        feels a little less smooth than it did during the beta, the reason may be a downgrade in server send rates from 60 hz to 20 hz.
